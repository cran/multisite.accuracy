Description: The effects of the site may severely bias the accuracy of a multisite machine-learning model, even if the analysts removed them when fitting the model in the 'training set' and when applying the model in the 'test set'. This simple R package estimates the accuracy of a multisite machine-learning model unbiasedly as described in (Solanes et al, Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 2021, in Press). It currently supports the estimation of sensitivity, specificity, balanced accuracy, the area under the curve, correlation, mean squarer error, and hazard ratio for binomial, gaussian, and survival (time-to-event) outcomes.
